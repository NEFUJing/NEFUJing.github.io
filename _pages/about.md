<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Associate Professor and master's supervisor in the Computer Science and Technology major at [Northeast Forestry University](https://www.nefu.edu.cn/). The main research directions are: artificial intelligence, deep learning, natural language processing, large models, etc. Prior to this, I obtained a doctoral degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/) in December 2023.

In recent years, I have been dedicated to applying technologies such as natural language processing, large language models, and neural networks to address practical issues in the fields of policy, law, and regulations, including text analysis, compliance detection, and question-answering systems.

[A Compliance Checking Framework Based on Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.178/)

**Sun, Jingyun**, Zhongze Luo, Yang Li*

- We propose a compliance checking framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This framework includes a static layer for storing factual knowledge, a dynamic layer for storing regulatory and business process information, and a computational layer for retrieval and reasoning. We employ an eventic graph to structurally describe regulatory information as we recognize that the knowledge in regulatory documents is centered not on entities but on actions and states. We conducted experiments on Chinese and English compliance checking datasets.

[A Multi-Source Heterogeneous Knowledge Injected Prompt Learning Method for Legal Charge Prediction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494625007495)

**Sun, Jingyun***, Chi Wei

- We propose a prompt learning framework-based method that simultaneously leverages multi-source heterogeneous external legal knowledge. Specifically, we match knowledge snippets in case descriptions via the legal knowledge base and encapsulate them into the input through a hard prompt template. Additionally, we retrieve legal articles related to the given case description through contrastive learning, and then obtain factual elements through a conversational Large Language Model (LLM). We fuse the embedding vectors of soft prompt tokens with the encoding vector of factual elements to achieve knowledge-enhanced model forward inference.
